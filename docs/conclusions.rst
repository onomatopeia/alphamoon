Conclusions
===========

Given that the assumption of class uniqueness was the basis for method selection, having this assumption violated results in the method not being optimally selected for the problem at hand.

First of all, it would be essential to understand whether existence of two distinct classes 14 and 30 for the same letter N was a mere mistake or maybe there was a legitimate reason behind it. The decision to merge the classes was based on a definition of a letter and the objective statement of the current assignment.

Nevertheless, given that the numbers of examples in each class are rather modest, a triplet network and a few-shot learning approach still appears to be a reasonable choice. A natural step further in the development towards the best model would be to use a convolutional neural network for embedding learning instead of a fully-connected one. Additionally, it is recommended to examine alternative approaches that do not attempt to solve the few-shot learning problem but are excellent at character recognition instead.
